    <h1>Crop Production</h1>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Search..">
    <h4>Crop production is a common agricultural practice followed by worldwide farmers to grow and produce crops to use as food and fibre. This practice includes all the feed sources that are required to maintain and produce crops.<br><br> Listed below are few practices used during crop production.
        
        <li>Preparation of Soil.</li> 
        <li>Sowing of Seeds. </li> 
        <li>Irrigation. </li> 
        <li>Application of manure, pesticides, and fertilizers to the crops. </li> 
        <li>Protecting and Harvesting Crops. </li>
        <li>Storage and Preserving the produced Crops. </li>
        <li>The ultimate stages of crop production are harvesting and storage. </li>
        <br>
        Harvesting requires art and practice because a large proportion of crops can be lost due to improper methods of harvesting. Another concern besides harvesting is storage. Storage of grains is to be given utmost priority as improper storage can result in the destruction of crops being by pests or unfavourable environmental conditions.
        Thus, it requires proper knowledge of crops grown in suitable conditions.Some of the crops are given here.

            Rice is the most important food crop of India. It is the staple food of the people in the eastern, southern and southwestern parts of the country. India has the largest area under rice in the world. But it is the second largest producer of rice, only after China. Rice is the major Kharif crop of India. It is primarily tropical crop, it requires high temperature of 180 to 250 c and heavy rainfall of 100-200cm per year. Alluvial and clayey loam soils are best suited for its cultivation. Rice needs standing water and it needs level land. Irrigation is necessary wherever rainfall is less. Rice is grown in almost all the states of India. West Bengal is the largest producer of rice in the country. The other important producers of rice are Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Karnataka.

            It is the second important food crop and major Rabi crop of India. Wheat is an important staple food in the northern and north western parts of the country. It is a crop of temperate regions. It requires moderate temperature of 100 to 150c and annual rainfall of 50 to 70 cm. Heavy loams and black soils are best suited for wheat cultivation. Wheat is mainly grown in the Northern plains including Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and northern part of Karnataka. Of which Uttar Pradesh is the largest producer of wheat in India. India is the second largest producer of wheat in the world next to China.

            Finger millet, also known as ragi in India,widely grown as a cereal crop in the arid and semiarid areas in Africa and Asia. Interesting crop characteristics of finger millet are the ability to withstand cultivation at altitudes over 2000 m above sea level, its high drought tolerance, and the long storage time of the grains. Finger millet is a short-day plant with a growing optimum 12 hours of daylight for most varieties. Heat tolerance of finger millet is high. For Ugandan finger millet varieties, for instance, the optimal average growth temperature ranges at about 27 °C, while the minimal temperatures should not be lower than 18 °C. Relative to other species (pearl millet and sorghum), finger millet has a higher tolerance to cool temperatures. It is grown from about 500 to about 2400 m above sea level (e.g. in Himalaya region). Hence, it can be cultivated on higher elevations than most tropical crops. Grown best in red soil.

            Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with the total production of maize surpassing that of wheat or rice. In addition to being consumed directly by humans (often in the form of masa), maize is also used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup.Because it is cold-intolerant, in the temperate zones maize must be planted in the spring. Its root system is generally shallow, so the plant is dependent on soil moisture. As a plant that uses C4 carbon fixation, maize is a considerably more water-efficient crop than plants that use C3 carbon fixation such as alfalfa and soybeans. A temperature of 21°C- 27°C and 50-100cm rainfall is suitable for its cultivation. Alternate spells of rains and sunny weather are ideal for maize. It is a Kharif Crop but in some states like Bihar, it is grown in the rabi season also. It grows well in alluvial and red soils with good drainage.

            Black pepper is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae, cultivated for its fruit, known as a peppercorn, which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning. Black pepper is native to present-day Kerala, a state on the southwestern coast of India, and is extensively cultivated there and in other tropical regions. Pepper can be grown in soil that is neither too dry nor susceptible to flooding, moist, well-drained, and rich in organic matter (the vines do not do well over an altitude of 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level). Pepper has high medicinal value and India is one of the major producers.

            A mango is an edible stone fruit is believed to have originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. Depending on the cultivar, mango fruit varies in size, shape, sweetness, skin color,and flesh color which may be pale yellow, gold, green, or orange. The mango is the national fruit of India, Pakistan and the Philippines, while the mango tree is the national tree of Bangladesh. The mango is now cultivated in most frost-free tropical and warmer subtropical climates.  Previously, mangoes were seasonal, because they only flowered every 16 to 18 months. The method is now used in most mango-producing countries. An important breakthrough in mango cultivation is the use of potassium nitrate and ethrel to induce flowering in mangoes.

            The orange is the fruit of various citrus species in the family Rutaceae. The orange originated in a region encompassing Southern China, Northeast India, and Myanmar. As of 1987, orange trees were found to be the most cultivated fruit tree in the world. Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates for their sweet fruit. In 2019, 79 million tonnes of oranges were grown worldwide, with Brazil producing 22% of the total, followed by China and India. Like most citrus plants, oranges do well under moderate temperatures between 15.5 and 29 °C (59.9 and 84.2 °F) and require considerable amounts of sunshine and water. As oranges are sensitive to frost, there are different methods to prevent frost damage to crops and trees when subfreezing temperatures are expected. A common process is to spray the trees with water so as to cover them with a thin layer of ice that will stay just at the freezing point, insulatingthem even if air temperatures drop far lower. This is because water continues to lose heat as long as the environment is colder than it is, and so the water turning to ice in the environment cannot damage the trees. This practice, however, offers protection only for a very short time.

            Rubber, also called India rubber, as initially produced, consists of polymers of the organic compound isoprene, with minor impurities of other organic compounds, plus water. The economic life period of rubber trees in plantations is around 32 years, up to 7 years of immature phase and about 25 years of productive phase. The soil requirement is well-drained, weathered soil consisting of laterite, lateritic types, sedimentary types, nonlateritic red or alluvial soils. Rainfall of around 250 centimetres (98 in) evenly distributed without any marked dry season and with at least 100 rainy days per year. Temperature range of about 20 to 34 °C (68 to 93 °F), with a monthly mean of 25 to 28 °C (77 to 82 °F), Atmospheric humidity of around 80%, About 2,000 hours sunshine per year at the rate of six hours per day throughout the year, Absence of strong winds.Many high-yielding clones have been developed for commercial planting. These clones yield more than 2,000 kilograms per hectare (1,800 lb/acre) of dry rubber per year, under ideal conditions.
