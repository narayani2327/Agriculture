    <h1>Crop Protection</h1>
    <h4>PESTICIDES are not recent-ly inventions(found)! 
        Many ancient civilizations used pesticides to protect their crops from insects and pests.
        Ancient Sumerians used elemental sulfur to protect their crops from insects. Whereas, Medieval farmers experimented with chemicals using arsenic, lead on common crops.
        The Chinese used arsenic and mercury compounds to control /body lice and /other pests. While, the Greeks and Romans used oil, ash, sulfur, and other materials to 
        protect themselves, their livestock, and their crops from various pests.</h4>
        <h3>TYPES</h3>
        <h4>
        <li>Insecticides – insects</li> 
        <li>Herbicides – plants</li> 
        <li>Rodenticides – rodents (rats & mice)</li> 
        <li>Bactericides – bacteria</li> 
        <li>Fungicides – fungi</li> 
        <li>Larvicides – larvae</li> </h4>
        <h3>Chemically-related pesticides:</h3> 
        <h4>
        <li>Organophosphate : Most organophosphates are insecticides</li>
        <li>Carbamate : Similar to the organophosphorus pesticides</li> 
        <li>Organochlorine insecticides : They were commonly used earlier, but now many countries have been removed Organochlorine insecticides from their market due to their health and environmental effects and their persistence (e.g., DDT, chlordane, and toxaphene). </li>
        <li>Pyrethroid : They were developed in such a way as to maximise their stability in the environment. </li>
        <li>Sulfonylurea herbicides : The sulfonylureas herbicides have been commercialized for weed control. </li>
        <li>Biopesticides : The biopesticides are certain types of pesticides derived from such natural materials as animals, plants, bacteria, and certain minerals. </li>

            <li>Lesions develop a tan center and red-brown or orange border.</li> 
            <li>Lesions may coalesce to form large necrotic(dead) patches.</li> 
            <li>Severely infected leaves on susceptible hybrids may wither and die.</li> 
            <li>Fungal fruiting bodies develop on dead tissues and may produce pink or orange spore masses.</li> 
            <li>Top dieback and stalk rot.</li> 
            <br> <b style="font-size:25px;">Management:</b>
            <li>Plant hybrids resistant to anthracnose; rotating crops and plowing crop debris into soil may help reduce incidence of early season infections.</li>

    <h3>Cercospora leaf spot (Gray leaf spot)</h3>
    <div class="dis">
        <div class="text">
            Disease emergence is favored in areas where a corn crop is followed by more corn with no rotastion; severity and incidence of disease is likely die to continuous corn culture with minimum tillage and the use of susceptible hybrids in in the midwestern corn belt of the USA; prolonged periods of foggy or cloudy weather can cause severe Cercopora epidemics. <br> <br>
            <b style="font-size:25px;">Symptoms:</b>
            <li>Small necrotic spots with chlorotic halos on leaves which expand to rectangular lesions 1-6 cm in length and 2-4 mm wide; as the lesions mature they turn tan in color and finally gray; lesions have sharp, parallel edges and are opaque; disease can develop quickly causing complete blighting of leaves and plant death.</li> 
            <li>Brown Spots with yellow rings throughout the leaf during the growing period of the Cassava.</li> 
            <li>Lesions that are 0.15-0.2 cm in diameter.</li> 
            <li>Serious cases can lead to holes throughout the lesions on the leaf.</li> 
            <br> <b style="font-size:25px;">Management:</b>
            <li>Plant corn hybrids with resistance to the disease; crop rotation and plowing debris into soil may reduce levels of inoculum in the soil but may not provide control in areas where the disease is prevalent; foliar fungicides may be economically viable for some high yeilding susceptible hybrids.</li>

    <div class="dis">
        <img src="image/char.jpg" alt="Charcoal Rot">
        <div class="text">
            Emergence of the disease is favored by warm soils with a low moisture content; fungus overwinters in the soil and can also survive on other host plants which include sorghum and soybean. <br> <br>
            <b style="font-size:25px;">Symptoms:</b>
           <li>Symptoms are usually first apparent at the tasseling stage; plant stalks become shredded and pith is completely rotted with stringy strands of vascular tissue left intact; small, black fungal fruiting bodies are visible in the vascular strands and give the tissue a gray coloration; fungus grows into internodes of the stalk causing the plant to ripen early and causing the stalk to weaken; plant may break.</li> 
           <br> <b style="font-size:25px;">Management:</b>
            <li>There are currently no available fungicides to treat the disease; avoid stressing plants by practicing good water management; rotating crops with small grains may help reduce disease incidence.</li>

            Fungus had a wide host range and affects beans, tobacco, soybean, pigeon pea and many other crops; disease is primarily spread via microsclerota in the soil. <br><br>
            <b style="font-size:25px;">Symptoms:</b>
            <li>Discoloration of vine at soil line; cankers on stem may spread upwards; leaves may wilt and drop from plant; numerous small black sclerota (fungal fruiting bodies) develop in affected tissues and can be used to diagnose the disease.</li>
            <br> <b style="font-size:25px;">Management:</b>
            <li>Organic soil amendments such as the addition of manure or neemcake can be used to reduce levels of inocuum in the soil.</li>

    <div class="dis">
        <div class="text">
            Can be transmitted to a field through infected runners or roots and adhering soil; foot rot is a destructive disease in Malaysia and Indonesia; emergence of the disease is favored by wet, poorly draining soil. <br><br>
            <b style="font-size:25px;">Symptoms:</b>
            <li>Black water soaked lesions on leaves and/or stems during wet weather; symptoms usually develop on lower leaves which have been splashed by water; leaves wilt rapidly and drop from plant; entire vine is killed within a period of days to weeks.</li>
            <br> <b style="font-size:25px;">Management:</b>
            <li>Avoid uneccessary tilling of soil which can be conducive to spreading the pathogen; a cover crop of grass can help prevent water splash on the plants and thus the sread of the fungi; amending the soil with neem cake suppresses the Phytophthora and provides nutrients to the vines; systemic fungicides such as metalaxyl and fosetyl can give some measure of control; efforts are being made to establish resistant verieties.</li>
